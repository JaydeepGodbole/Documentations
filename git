Git Commits
A commit in a git repository records a snapshot of all the files in your directory. It's like a giant copy and paste, but even better!
Git wants to keep commits as lightweight as possible though, so it doesn't just blindly copy the entire directory every time you commit. It can (when possible) compress a commit as a set of changes, or a "delta", from one version of the repository to the next.
$  git commit

Git branches
git  branch branch_name



Git clone- Its  used to download a remote repository in your pc
$ git clone

Git pull - Its a command which is a combination of git fetch and git merge.
$ git pull

Git push- Used to push changes to remote
Always needed to update local repo before pushing, so that no incorrect commit histories exist.

Pull requests- They are used to request a master to pull changes from branch of a forked repo.
